After recovering from a week of intense illness, Jenelle and I were looking to have a little adventure in northern Thailand. Bright eyed and bushy tailed, we decided to tackle the 600 km Mae Hong Son Loop on a 125 cc Yamaha scooter. With a rough itinerary, adventurous spirit, and a little help from Google Maps, we hit the road ready to conquer whatever the loop could throw at us!

The MHS loop consists of a whopping 1,864 curves, winding its way through some of the most beautiful parts of the rural mountainous north.

<h2> Pai </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Around 150 kilometers lie between Chiang Mai and Pai, the first stop on the loop. Pai is a tourist town nestled in the mountains, known as one of the biggest hippy-backpacker destinations in South East Asia. The ride to Pai becomes very scenic once you get off Highway 107 and onto the 1095; there’s a lot of fun to be had conquering the passes and tight mountainous driving that the 1095 has to offer. Beware of Thai drivers though, they’ll barrel around blind corners in whichever lane they please. I found this stretch of the loop to be the busiest, as many people only make the trip to Pai and back. 
<br>
<br>
Pai is a polarizing place. Some sneer at what used to be an “authentic” Northern Thailand experience, now turned into the biggest tourist trap north of Bangkok. Others enjoy the accessibility and convenience that is now baked-into the chilled-out destination.

We spent our 3 days in Pai chilling out, as most do. We met cool people and enjoyed lazy afternoons from the comfort of our hammocks. It was a fun experience, but in the end the scene really wasn’t for me. We were actively trying to partake in an adventure, not escape it. 
</div>

<h2>Tham Lot Cave</h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Tham Lot Cave turned out to be my favorite part of the MHS loop. The day starts with a 49 km ride from Pai - what was once hairpin turns and steep decents turned into gently banking curves and open roads. I actually had a change to enjoy the scenery as soared throgh the impressive karst topography, no longer actively fleeing he  unpredictable wrath of Thai pickup trucks. 
<br>
<br>
Beautiful colors and amazing geologic formations await inside the depths of Tham Lot. The cave was used as an ancient tomb, with 3000-year-old coffins and wall paintings are scattered throughout. Tham Lot is a wonderful experience as long as you’re not claustrophobic, and don’t mind the occasional cave critter.  Unfortunately, this meant Jenelle was terrified the entire time.

<h2> Mae Hong Son </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
After experiencing Tham Lot, 74 kilometers lie between you and the province's capital, Mae Hong Son city. The drive is stunning, but try to finish it before dusk roles around. I took a good number of flying jungle bugs to the face at 60 km/hr before I wisened up and pulled down my helmet's visor. 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps due to the lack of tourism, Mae Hong Son feels a bit tucked away. Don’t let that fool you, there’s plenty to see and learn.
<br>
<br>
Taking a closer look, we found that Mae Hong Son province is home to many Shan people. An ethnic minority in Thailand, the Shan people have fled the conflict ridden Shan State of Northeast Burma. They speak the Shan language, and look distinctly different than the Thai. The pagodas scattered about the city have a Burmese style, and the houses are crafted uniquely as well. 
<br>
<br>
Karen “long neck” tribes, also minority refugees from Burma, have small villages around Mae Hong Son. We decided to not visit the nearby village, as we heard they have a "human zoo" feeling to them. I’m certain it would be an interesting experience though.

<h2> Doi Inthanon </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
The loop becomes a bit harder to navigate after Mae Hong Son - our clean, freshly paved roadway was now strewn with potholes, mud, and the occasional water buffalo. Along the 200 km ride to Doi Inthanon National Park, we took a pit stop at the village of Khun Yuam. 
<br><br>
Nearly impossible to find on a map, Khun Yuam once played an important role in the Pacific Theater of WWII. The final staging point for the Japanese invasion of British held Burma, Khun Yuam now commemorates the war with a Thailand-Japanese Friendship Memorial. 
<br>
<br>
More a museum than anything else, the Friendship Memorial is worth a visit. 
<br>
<br>
After Khun Yuam we hit an all-time low in the scooter adventure as we headed Mae Chaem, the evening's destination. Already sore from the previous 120 kilometer ridden that day, we were in a race against dusk to reach our destination. It would have worked out all right, if it weren’t for the torrential rainstorm that afternoon. 
<br><br>
The 80 kilometer stretch of the southwest corner of the loop is by far the most remote; jungle as far as the eye can see. 
<br><br>
With nowhere to stop and take shelter, we carried on; winding through the tight mountain roads that now resembled streams more than roads. It lasted for several hours, but felt like several years. By the time we stumbled into Mae Chaem, it was well past dusk. Everything was soaked, but our it was spirits took the most damage.
<br><br>
I guess they call it the rainy season for a reason.

A 30 minute ride east of Mae Chaem, we finally made it to Doi Inthanon, our last stop on the loop. As the tallest mountain in Thailand, Doi Inthanon commands spectacular views of the north. Unfortunately, visibility was limited to around ten feet due to the mist and fog. The rainy season strikes again. 
<br><br>
We quickly checked checked out Naphamethinidon and Naphaphonphumisiri, the twin chedi near the summit, as well as several impressive waterfalls within the park. As impressive as it all was, we ha not recovered from the previous night's trauma. We had experienced our share of adventure for the week. 
<br><br>
After another two hours ride, we had finally made it back to Chiang Mai, successfully completing the Mae Hong Son Loop. We went out looking for adventure and boy we found it. A week of massive caves, twisting roads, impressive mountains, interesting people, creepy critters, and scary drivers. 
<br><br>
Completing the loop was a little tougher than I thought it would be, scooters aren't all that comfortable after 8 hours riding. We were a little tougher than I thought too though. All-in-all it was an amazing adventure that I would certainly recommend - just keep careful and keep your wits about you on the road!
