	Bustling Hong Kong is the fourth most densely populated country in the world, and it certainly feels like it. With skyscrapers, mountains, and people everywhere you look, it’s easy to get lost in the metropolis. To help make the most of your time in Hong Kong, I’ve compiled a list of my top five recommended activities.

My pick of the top 5 places you should visit while in Hong Kong.
</div>

<h2> 1. Lantau Island </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Lantau Island should be on the top of your radar when visiting Hong Kong. To get here take the MTR to the Tung Chung station, exit B. From the station, you have two options – take the Ngong Ping Cable Car, or take New Lantau Bus number 23. The cable car will set you back around $18 (USD), while the bus costs $2 to $4 depending on the day of the week. 
<br>
<br>
I suggest arriving early, as there is nearly a full day worth of activities here, and it gets crowded after 1pm. 
<br>
<br>
The first thing you’ll likely encounter is the Ngong Ping Village – a fake village set up to sell you souvenirs (and also western food). Skip the village unless you’re hungry or itching to spend some money on a small Tian Tan replica. The Big Buddha towers over you to the south, it’s best to tackle the stairs up to him first thing. The view from the top would be excellent, if it weren’t for the pollution. The Buddha itself is the most impressive part of the climb.

<div class="important">
Tian Tan Buddha (Big Buddha) symbolizes the harmonious relationship between man and nature, people and faith. 
</div>

<div class="blog-content">
After you’ve conquered the Big Buddha and taken some obligatory selfies, it’s time to explore Po Lin Monastery. With beautiful grounds and vibrant temples, the monastery is a very memorable experience. Take your time and make sure not to miss the hall of 10,000 Buddha’s. If you still have some energy left, I recommend checking out the path of wisdom, just a 10-minute walk east of the monastery. 
<br>
<br>
The only costs associated with the Lantau Island attractions are transportation and food. The whole excursion can be done for around $10 if you choose to take the bus and eat cheaply.

<h2> 2. Victoria Peak </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Offering great panoramic views of Central Hong Kong, Kowloon, and beyond, everyone knows that you must visit The Peak when in Hong Kong. There are two ways to climb the peak – by tram, or by bus. The tram costs around $12 for a round trip ticket, while the bus comes in around $2.50. Considering the hour and a half wait time for the tram, we again opted to take the bus. 
<br>
<br>
If you’re interested in taking the bus to Victoria Peak, head to the Exchange Square station just across from the Star Ferry piers on Hong Kong Island. Look for bus number 15. The ride to the top should take about 45 minutes, but is done in less than 30 due to the speedy (scary) bus drivers. 
<br>
<br>
If you can manage, sunrise is supposed to be a great time to visit The Peak. If you can’t manage, any time that visibilities is high would be good. Expect a lot of company at the top if you’re headed there for sunset!
<br>

<h2> 3. Victoria Harbor </h2>
<div class="blog-content">
It used to be that the ferry was the only way to travel between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island -  the MTR subway has put an end to that. None the less, the ferry is a novelty and shouldn’t be missed. If you can time it, take the ferry from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon while the symphony of lights is in full swing at 8pm. You won’t have to look around hundreds of iPhones and iPads held above tourists heads to see the show. You also won’t have to suffer through the smell of the Victoria Harbor shoreline if you’re viewing the lightshow from the ferry. 
<br>
<br>
The ferry costs around $0.30 for a one way journey – it makes for a pleasant journey across the historically important trade harbor.

<h2> 4. The Hong Kong Museum of History </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
This museum is amazing. If you’re at all interested in the natural history, archeology, cultural roots, or recent history of Hong Kong, you must make a visit. The museum has excellent exhibits with English translations at each display.
<br>
<br>
There is something for everyone at the Hong Kong Museum of History, and the best part is it’s completely free!

If you’re itching for more educational goodness after you’ve gobbled up the museum, check out the Hong Kong Science Museum right next door! For around $2.00 you can check out another world class educational experience.

<h2> 5. Mongkok Night Market </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
While I’m not really into shop-cations or big crowds, Mongkok is a memorable experience. There’s a lot of sights, sounds, and smells to take in! It’s an authentic, more personal Hong Kong experience. 
<br>
<br>
While at the night market, I encountered an Eric Clapton cover band (with a Cantonese twist), an elderly Chinese man with moves with MJ, an acrobat troop, and a whole lot more. If you’re interested in buying a souvenir or just want an excuse to try your hand at haggling, you’ll find plenty of opportunity here.

Hong Kong is an intense city. When so many experiences and people are packed into one place it can be overwhelming. While it would take years to truly get to know the city, I was ready to go after an extended weekend. Hong Kong is really a different world – I hope my top 5 makes your experience a little more awesome!
