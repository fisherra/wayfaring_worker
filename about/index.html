    It all started with the father-son trip of a lifetime to beautiful Scotland. It didn't take me long to realize that I loved travelling, and that I was willing to do whatever it took to keep the adventure going. 
  </p>

    It was the summer of 2016 when we took that trip to Scotland. I had just graduated college with my bachelor's degree in Geophysics. It was a celebratory trip that ended up bringing real conflict to my life. The trip was beyond amazing, like nothing I had ever experienced. I wanted <i>more</i> - but that wasn't the plan. I was supposed to work in my field, go to graduate school and earn six figures in the oil industry. That's what I had been preparing for after all. Was I going to let my efforts go to waste? I decided to try and sweep it all under the rug, accepting a job at the United States Geological Survey upon returning from Scotland. 
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, the work was enjoyable. It was nice to finally earn money from my field - no homework or exams to stress over... it was a welcome change. I even managed to negotiate five weeks of leave for another trip to Europe upon accepting the job offer, hoping that maybe this would be enough to make me happy.

    Backpacking around Europe during the fall of 2016 solidified it for me: splurge trips just weren't enough. Expensive vacations that end too soon weren't my thing. I wanted to take my time and <i>enjoy</i> working, living, and exploring wherever I please. So, while I finished my obligations at the United States Geological Survey, my priorities shifted in a big way. I had to build a life of location independence that properly balances adventure and achievement.

  <h2> Work </h2>

  <p>
    Epic adventures in far away lands don't come free. The good news is that you <b>can</b> work and wander at the same time! There are many paths to location independence, and some are easier than others. While some websites peddle their travel blogging courses as the secret to a luxurious travel lifestyle, Wayfaring Worker takes a different approach.
