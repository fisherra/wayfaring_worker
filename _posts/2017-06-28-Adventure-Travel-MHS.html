<div class="blog-content">
After recovering from a week of gut-wrenching illness Jenelle and I were looking to have a little adventure in northern Thailand. Bright eyed and bushy tailed, we decided to tackle the 600 km Mae Hong Son Loop on the back of a 125 cc Yamaha scooter. With a rough itinerary, adventurous spirit, and google, we hit the road ready to conquer whatever the loop had to throw at us!

<div class="important">
The MHS loop consists of 1864 curves, winding its way through some of the most beautiful parts of the rural mountainous north. 
</div>

<h2> Pai </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Around 150 km lie between Chiang Mai and the stop on the loop, Pai. Pai is a tourist town nestled in the mountains, known to be the hippy-backpacker destination of northern Thailand. The ride becomes very scenic once you get off Highway 107 and onto the 1095, there’s a lot of fun to be had conquering the passes and tight mountainous driving that the 1095 offers. Beware of Thai drivers though, they’ll barrel around blind corners taking up whichever lane they please. I found this stretch of the loop to be the busiest, as many people only make the trip to Pai and back. 
<br>
<br>
Pai is a polarizing place; some sneer at what used to be an “authentic” Northern Thailand experience, now turned into the biggest tourist trap north of Bangkok. Others enjoy the accessibility and convenience that is now baked-into the chilled-out destination.

<div class="blog-content">
We spent our 3 days in Pai meeting cool people and allowing ourselves plenty of time to relax and take it slow. It was a fun experience, but in the end the scene really wasn’t for me. We were actively trying to partake in an adventure, not escape it.

<h2>Tham Lot Cave</h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Tham lot Cave topped off my favorite day on the MHS loop. The 49 km between Pai and Tham Lot ride like a racetrack. Gently banking curves and very little traffic let you soar through the impressive karst ridden jungle. I actually had a chance to take in the scenery instead of fleeing the wrath of Thai pickup trucks.
<br>
<br>
Beautiful colors and amazing geologic formations await inside the depths of Tham Lot. The cave 
 was also used as an ancient tomb, 3000-year-old coffins and wall paintings are scattered about. Tham Lot is a wonderful experience as long as you’re not claustrophobic, and don’t mind the occasional cave critter.  Unfortunately, this meant Jenelle was terrified the entire time.

<h2> Mae Hong Son </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Seventy-four kilometers lie between Tham Lot and the provinces’ capital city, Mae Hong Son. The drive is stunning, but try to finish it before the sun starts setting. I took a good number of giant jungle bugs to the face at 60 km/hr before I wizened up and pulled down my visor. 
<br>
<br>
Perhaps due to the lack of tourism, Mae Hong Son feels a bit tucked away. Don’t let that fool you though, there’s plenty to see and learn.
<br>
<br>
Taking a closer look, we found that Mae Hong Son province is home to many Shan people. An ethnic minority in Thailand, the Shan people have fled the conflict ridden Shan State of Northeast Burma. They speak the Shan Language, and look distinctly different than the Thai. The pagodas scattered about the city have a Burmese style, and the houses are crafted differently. 
<br>
<br>
Karen “Long Neck” tribes, also minority refugees from Burma, have small villages around Mae Hong Son. We decided to not visit the nearby village, as we heard they have a human-zoo feeling to them. I’m certain it would be an interesting experience though.

<h2> Doi Inthanon </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
The loop becomes a bit harder to navigate after Mae Hong Son; our freshly paved, clean roadway was now strewn with potholes, mud patches, and the occasional water buffalo. Along the 200 km ride to Doi Inthanon National Park, we took a pit stop at Khun Yuam. 
<br><br>
Nearly impossible to find on a map, Khun Yuam once played an important role in the Pacific Theater of WWII. The final staging point for the Japanese invasion of British held Burma, Khun Yuam now commemorates the war with a Thailand-Japanese Friendship Memorial. 
<br>
<br>
More a museum than anything else, the Friendship Memorial is worth a visit. 
<br>
<br>
We hit an all-time low in the scooter adventure as we headed for Mae Chaem, our evening’s destination. Already sore from the previous 120 km ridden that day, we were in a race against dusk to reach our destination. It would have worked out alright, if it weren’t for the torrential rainstorm that afternoon. 
<br><br>
The 80 km stretch of the southwest corner of the loop is by far the most remote; jungle as far as the eye can see. 
<br><br>
With nowhere to stop and take shelter, we carried on; ascending and descending the tight mountain roads that now looked and felt more like streams than anything else. It lasted for several hours, but felt like several years. By the time we blundered into Mae Chaem, it was well past dusk. We, and everything we owned, were completely soaked. 
<br><br>
I guess they call it the rainy season for a reason.

About 30 minutes east of Mae Chaem, we finally made it to Doi Inthanon. As the tallest mountain in Thailand, Doi Inthanon commands spectacular views of the north. Unfortunately, visibility was limited to about 10 feet because of all the mist. The rainy season strikes again. 
<br><br>
We quickly checked checked out Naphamethinidon and Naphaphonphumisiri, the twin chedi near the summit, as well as several impressive waterfalls within the park. As impressive as it all was, we were about through with this adventure. 
<br><br>
After another two hours of driving, we had finally made it back to Chiang Mai, successfully completing the MHS Loop. We went out looking for adventure and boy had we found it. A week of massive caves, twisting roads, impressive mountains, interesting people, creepy critters, and scary drivers. 
<br><br>
The loop was a little tougher than I thought it would be, but we were a little tougher than I thought too. All in all it was an amazing adventure that I would certainly recommend, just keep careful on the road!
