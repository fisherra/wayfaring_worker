	Bustling Hong Kong is the fourth most densely populated country in the world, and it certainly feels like it. With mountains, skyscrapers, and people everywhere you look, it’s easy to get lost in this metropolis. To help make the most of your time in Hong Kong, I’ve compiled this list of my top five recommended activities!

Mapping out my pick of the top 5 places you should visit while in Hong Kong.
</div>

<h2> 1. Lantau Island </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Lantau Island should be high on your radar when visiting Hong Kong. Colorful temples, scenic views, colorful temples, and a Big Buddha all packed together make for a memorable experience while in Hong Kong. 
<br><br>
To get to Lantau Island, take the MTR to the Tung Chung station exit B. From exit B, you have two options – take the Ngong Ping Cable Car, or take New Lantau Bus Line 23. The cable car will set you back around $24 round trip, but offers excellent views and a relaxing 30 minute ride. Bus Line 23 costs around $5 for a round trip, and comes with complimentary motion sickness on the 40 minute ride.
<br>
<br>
Plan on arriving early, as there is nearly a full day worth of activities here, and it gets pretty crowded after 1pm. 
<br>
<br>
The first thing you’ll likely encounter is the Ngong Ping Village – a fake traditional village set up to sell you souvenirs and a bit of food. Skip the village unless you’re hungry or itching to spend some money on a small Tian Tan Buddha replica. The Big Buddha towers over you to the south, it’s best to tackle the stairs leading up to him first thing. The view from the top would be excellent, if it weren’t for all of the pollution.

Tian Tan Buddha (Big Buddha) symbolizes the harmonious relationship between man and nature, people and faith. 
</div>

<div class="blog-content">
After you’ve conquered the climb to Big Buddha and taken some obligatory selfies, it’s time to explore Po Lin Monastery. With beautifully curated grounds and vibrant temples, the monastery is among the best in Hong Kong. Make sure not to miss the hall of 10,000 Buddhas, it's awesome. 
<br><br>
If it's not too hot and you still have some energy left, I recommend checking out the path of wisdom - just a 10-minute walk east of the monastery. It's a very short hike riddled with huge carvings of ancient chinese wisdom and scenic mountain views. 
<br>
<br>
The only costs associated with the Lantau Island attractions are transportation and food. The whole excursion can be done for around $10 if you opt for the bus and eat cheaply. 
</div>

<h2> 2. Victoria Peak </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
Offering great panoramic views of Hong Kong Island and beyond, you've got to visit Victoria Peak while in Hong Kong. There are two ways to climb the peak – by tram, or by bus. The tram costs around $12 for a round trip ticket, while the bus comes in around $2.50. Considering the hour and a half wait time for the tram, we again chose to take the bus. 
<br>
<br>
If you’re interested in taking the bus to Victoria Peak, head to the Exchange Square station just across from the piers on Hong Kong Island. Look for bus line 15. The ride to the top should take about 45 minutes, but is done in less than 30 due to <i>effective</i> bus drivers. 
<br>
<br>
If you can manage, sunrise is a great time to visit The Peak. If you can’t manage, any time that visibilities is high would be good. Expect a lot of company at the top if you’re headed there for sunset!
</div>

<h2> 3. Victoria Harbor </h2>
<div class="blog-content">
It used to be that the ferry was the only way to travel between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island; the MTR has put an end to that. None the less, the ferry is a novelty experience that shouldn’t be missed. If you can time it, take the ferry from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon during the nightly symphony of lights at 8pm. You won’t have to struggle to look around hundreds of people and iPhones to see the show. You also won’t have to suffer through the smell of the Victoria Harbor shoreline!

<div class="important">
The ferry costs around $0.30 for a one way journey – it makes for a pleasant journey across the impressive harbor. 
</div>

<h2> 4. The Hong Kong Museum of History </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
This museum is amazing. If you’re at all interested in the natural history, archeology, cultural roots, or recent history of Hong Kong, you have to give it a visit. The museum has excellent exhibits with English translations at each display.
</div>


<div class="image-template">

</div>
<div class="important">
There is something for everyone at the Hong Kong Museum of History, and the best part is it’s completely free! 
</div>

<div class="blog-content">
If you’re itching for more educational goodness after the museum of history, check out the Hong Kong Science Museum right next door! They've got more top notch exhibits, often rotating in collections all the way from the British Museum. 
</div>

<h2> 5. Mongkok Night Market </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
I’m not big into shop-cations or crowded venues, but still found that the Mongkok Night Market is a memorable experience that you shouldn't miss while in Hong Kong. There’s a lot of sights, sounds, and smells to take in! It’s an authentic, more personal Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>
While at the night market, I encountered an Eric Clapton cover band with a evident cantonese influences, an elderly Chinese man with moves with MJ, an acrobat troop, and a whole lot more. If you’re interested in buying a souvenir or just want an excuse to try your hand at haggling, you’ll find plenty of opportunity here.

Hong Kong is really a different world – I hope my top 5 help make your experience a little more awesome!
