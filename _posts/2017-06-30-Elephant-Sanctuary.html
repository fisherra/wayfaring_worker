Visiting an elephant sanctuary is perhaps the activity northern Thailand is mst famous for, but I'll have to admit I was a skeptic in the beginning. I kept putting it off, worried that the experience would feel like manufactured fun – forced and un-authentic. I wasn’t too keen on paying a bunch of money to follow in the steps of every other Thailand tourist, petting and bathing some wrinkly pachyderm, smiling for pictures the entire time. 
<br><br>
Eventually, our time in Chiang Mai was coming to an end, and I couldn’t put it off any longer. So despite my reservations, we committed to visit an elephant sanctuary... and I'm <i>so happy</i> we did. 
<br><br>
Picked up from our apartment at precisely 6:30am, we drove 2 hours southwest of Chiang Mai to Dumbo Elephant Sanctuary. The winding drive to the sanctuary was a terrifying experience thanks to our (possibly insane) van driver, Chirapat. If you’re ever in Thailand and value your health, I’d advise avoiding long-distance, Thai-driven public transportatio as much as possible. Seriously.
<br><br>
Upon arrival we immediately changed into the provided traditional tribal clothing. They just looked like hippy drug rugs to me. Given a plasticmbag of assorted fruits and a few stalks of a large grass-like plant, we were off to feed the elephants.

The sanctuary is home to seven elephants in total, including two younglings, one adult male, and four adult females. The youngest elephant, Dumbo, is everyone’s favorite. I didn’t really like him though, he was really just a rowdy little delinquent.

We spent about two hours feeding and playing with the elephants, and it was honestly a whole lot of fun. Each elephant had a unique personality; one disliked the bananas and would only eat mangos. Another elephant would gently wrap its trunk around the food in your hand and take it from you gently. Dumbo ran around headbutting people, generally being a nuisance.

Eventually we had enough of feeding and petting the elephants, it was time to head down to the stream to give them a bit of a bath. Again, I thought this would be a bit gimmicky, and again it ended up being a lot of fun.

Lunch was served after we returned from the jungle bath, which was quite taisty. After lunch had a bit of time to just hang out and chat, observing the elephants from a distance. A little bit after noon we returned to Chiang Mai.

<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<div class="blog-content">
All in all, I had an amazing time at the elephant sanctuary. I would recommend Dumbo Elephant Spa's half day package to anyone. It cost 1600 baht ($45) and felt like just the right amount of time. The staff was fun and helpful, the elephants were happy, and the food was good.

I guess I was wrong, sometimes the touristy experiences are highlighted for good reason. Even though the experience was bought and payed for, I really did have an amazing time with some pretty cool people. It turns out that playing with big wrinkly pachyderms really is that fun.
