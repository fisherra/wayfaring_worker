Visiting an elephant sanctuary near Chiang Mai, Thailand is one of those must do activities; but I was a skeptical. For some reason, I kept putting it off. I was worried that the experience would feel like manufactured fun – forced and un-authentic. I wasn’t too keen on paying a bunch of money to follow in the steps of every other Thailand tourist and pet some big wrinkly pachyderm. 
<br><br>
Finally, our time in Chiang Mai was coming to an end, and I couldn’t put off the experience any longer. We finally committed to visit an elephant sanctuary, and I’m so happy we did. 
<br><br>
Picked up from our apartment at precisely 6:30am, we drove 2 hours southwest of Chiang Mai to the sanctuary. The winding drive to the sanctuary was the most terrifying experience I’ve had in Thailand, thanks to our (possibly insane) van driver, Chirapat. If you’re ever in Thailand and value your health, I’d advise you to avoid taking any long-distance, Thai-driven public transportation. Seriously.
<br><br>
We immediately changed into Thailand’s version of hippie drug rugs, and were given a bag of fruit to feed to the elephants.

The sanctuary is home to seven elephants in total, including two younglings, one adult male, and four adult females. The youngest elephant, Dumbo, is by default everyone’s favorite. I didn’t really like him though, he was a rowdy little delinquent.

We spent about two hours feeding and playing with the elephants; it was honestly a lot of fun. Each elephant felt like they had a unique personality; one disliked the bananas and would only eat mangos. Another elephant would take the food from you very gently.

Eventually it was time to head down to the stream to give the elephants a bath. Again, I was a bit hesitant about more manufactured-fun, but again, we had a really great time.

Lunch was served after we returned from the jungle bath, it was quite good. We had a bit of down time to talk and hang out with the other participants, then headed back to Chiang Mai. 
<br><br>
All in all the experience lasted for about eight hours: four hours of driving, four hours of elephant time. The half day package was just the right amount of time in my opinion. Besides, it started raining when we left around 1pm, as it usually does in northern Thailand. 
<br><br>
We chose to book with Dumbo Elephant Spa – it cost 1600 baht or about $45 per person for the half day experience. Cheaper than nearly every other option, I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a similar experience. The staff was fun and helpful, the elephants were happy, and the food was good. 
<br><br>
It seems that I was wrong to be skeptical of the man-made elephant sanctuary experience. I’m very happy embarked on this touristy-experience; I had an amazing time with some pretty cool people. It turns out that playing with a big wrinkly pachyderm really is that fun.
