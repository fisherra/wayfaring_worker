Home to nearly a million people, Chiang Mai provides the luxuries of a modern city while retaining the atmosphere and charm of a northern Thai village. If you're wandering the mountains and jungles of northern Thailand, you'll likely spend some time in this unforgettable city. I've put together a few tips to help you make the most of your time in Chiang Mai.

There are several important districts in Chiang Mai. A likely point of entry, Chiang Mai International Airport (purple), is located just southwest of the old town. If you're headed to Nimman or the old town, transportation to and from the airport should cost no more than 150 baht per person; the price may go as low as 100 baht depending on your patience and bargaining skills. 
<br><br>
Chiang Mai's old town, or old city (green) is the ancient heart of the city.  Established in 1296, the old city is surrounded by a square structure of walls and moats. Temples from the 14th century are scattered alongside bars, restaurants, hostels and 7-elevens throughout the old town. Most of the city's major tourist attractions are found here. 
<br><br>
Wat Lok Molee and Wat Chiang Man are two of my favorite temples in Chiang Mai, both located in northern part of the old city. The Tha Phae Gate and Thaphae Boxing Stadium both warrant a visit to the eastern side. Night markets appear in the southern half of the old town each night. Check out the Saturday Night Walking Street on Wua Lai Road.

The popular Nimman area, or Nimmanahaeminda road (red), runs just northwest of the old city and southeast of Chiang Mai University.  Frequented by students and expats alike, Nimman has all the amenities you need for a comfortable western lifestyle. Trendy coffee shops, co-working spaces, and foreigner-friendly apartment complexes dominate the Nimman area. 
<br><br>
Some of my favorite spots in the Nimman area are Q2 coffee, The Salad Concept, O-b-One Haircut, and Nimman House Thai Massage. Itâ€™s easy to spend hours exploring the endless cafes and boutique shops in the side streets of Nimman. The new, ultra-modern Maya Lifestyle Mall marks the cornerstone of the Nimman area, be sure to check it out. 
<br><br>
A bit further from the action, Central Festival Mall (orange) to the northeast is an important location to remember. It's a massive mall, but more importantly it's home to the Thai Immigration office. If you're looking to extend your visa, or have any other immigration-related issues, you'll pay a visit to Central Festival. Because of the recent move, there are conflicting reports on the internet of where to go for a visa extension - Central Festival is what you're looking for, so don't listen to Google maps! 
<br><br>
It's entirely possible to enjoy Chiang Mai by foot, especially if you're not out in the heat of the day. Catching a songthaew, or 'red truck' is another great option to get around. Often the songthaew driver will give a little honk as he drives by; this is an invitation to pick you up. Wave to the driver and tell him your destination, then hop in the back and pay 30 baht upon arrival. Easy!

Uber is another good option for transportation - especially if you're off the beaten path or in a hurry. We never paid more than 100 baht for even the longest Uber rides within the city. I would avoid using taxis and tuk tuks as bartering with them is usually a hassle and you still end up paying more than you should. Unless you want the novelty experience, there are much better options in Chiang Mai. 
<br><br>
If you're looking for a destination outside of the city, there are almost always reasonably priced public transportation options. However, none of these options will rival the freedom and enjoyment of renting and riding a scooter! If you're comfortable with riding on two wheels and driving on the left-hand side of the road, a scooter could your best bet. Just be careful - Thailand's roads are notoriously dangerous, and there are shady traffic police looking to make a quick buck off of scooter-riding foreigners. 
<br><br>
We rented a Yamaha Mio 125 cc from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChiangMaiScooterRental/">Chiang Mai Scooter Rental</a> in the Nimman area. The rental cost 2500 baht for a month, which comes out to around $2.50 per day. A tank of gas will cost about $2, and last a week with moderate use.

Many travelers look forward to visiting an elephant sanctuary while in the north, and there are many options to choose from. Check out my take on an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/06/Elephant-Sanctuary.html">Elephant Sancutary</a>. If you're looking for some natural beauty check out Doi Inthanon National Park, about an hour southwest of Chiang Mai. Doi Suthep is home to the tallest mountains in Thailand, and some of the most impressive waterfalls in South East Asia.

Doi Suthep is an impressive temple located on the holy mountain west of Chiang Mai. Offering great views of the city, this is a destination that shouldn't be missed. If you're feeling adventurous and have a bit of time to spare, you can ride the <a href= "{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/06/Adventure-Travel-MHS.html">Mae Hong Son Loop</a>. It's an incredible journey, and probably my favorite part of my visit to the north. If you don't have time for the entire loop, just pay a visit to Pai, the chilled-out mountain town to the northwest. 
<br><br>
You can expect to budget anywhere between $25 and $50 per day while you explore northern Thailand. It all depends on how ambitious your itinerary is; you can read my Chiang Mai budget guide <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2017/07/How-Expensive-is-Chiang_Mai.html">here</a>. 
<br><br>
Chiang Mai is a truly remarkable destination with opportunities for endless fun and adventure. Few places in the world offer so much for so cheap. Hopefully you'll enjoy it so much that you can't help but return time and time again - I know I do!
