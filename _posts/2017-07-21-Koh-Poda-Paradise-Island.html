When you think of the Thai islands, you might picture beautiful tropical beaches with swaying palms, impressive limestone cliffs, powdery white sand, and turquoise waters. That’s what I had on my mind as I touched down at Krabi International Airport after spending a month exploring the mountains and jungles of northern Thailand. 
<br><br>
Soon I was disappointed by the beach-front tourist town of Ao Nang, Krabi. Its beach is narrow and strewn with litter and ocean debris. The murky brown water smells of sewage as it forcefully crashes into the Ao Nang shoreline. Everything about Ao Nang and its beach is just the opposite of what I imagined this tropical paradise to be. 
<br><br>

To be fair, July is the start of monsoon season in the Andaman Sea; the towns empty of tourists and the ocean becomes foreboding during the rainy months. 
</i>

<br><br>
Hoping that the effects of the monsoon would be local, I decided to check out Railay Beach. While legendary for its imposing limestone cliffs and soft white sand, the ocean remained unwelcoming. At least it no longer smelled contaminated!
<br><br>
After two days of exploring Krabi, the calm tropical blue-green waters I had imagined still eluded me.  
<br><br>
After doing a bit of research online, I decided to check out Koh Poda, a minor island about half an hour’s boat ride away from Ao Nang. Getting to Koh Poda is easy, but expensive. Purchase a roundtrip ticket from the Ao Nang longtail company for 300 baht and hop aboard the boat you’re ushered to. After a short, pleasant ride, you approach a string of small islands, the first of which is sure to impress you.

A 400 baht-per-person “foreigner fee” is posted on signs and collected as soon as you reach the island. The unforeseen expense somewhat detracts from the experience of arriving.

After paying a total of 700 baht, or around $20, I had around 6 hours to explore the 8-square kilometer island before the boat returned to Ao Nang. Immediately, I discovered that Koh Poda was nearly deserted. Two or three national park employees scavenged the shores, picking up any garbage that beached overnight. A small hut selling food and drink was hidden behind a few shady trees, the clerk napping in a hammock nearby. Besides my girlfriend and the four other day-trippers whom had chartered the longtail with us, the island was empty.

The deserted beaches of Koh Poda make it feel like you’ve found a hidden gem, a personal tropical paradise. That’s because you have. 
<br><br>
As soon as I stepped ashore, I knew I hit the jackpot. The water surrounding Koh Poda is like nothing I have ever seen – brilliant shades of blue, turquoise and green, crystal clear and comfortably temperate. The powdery white sand beaches are clean and wide; they wrap around the island in both directions. Massive limestone karsts jut out of the jungle and ocean, towering over you as a constant reminder that you’re in an exotic destination. Even small tropical fish curiously approach you as you enjoy the water.

The island feels unreal – it’s much better than the Thai beaches I had dreamed up.

Unfortunately, Jenelle and I couldn’t restrain ourselves from over-indulging in this tropical paradise. While we applied sunscreen four or five times, the ocean did a terrific job of washing it all off. We were left with week-long deep-red reminders of our time on Koh Poda.

Tour boats show up just after noon, serving lunch to their patrons on the far side of the island. They stay for a little over an hour, then jet off to their next island destination. Curiously, the island hoppers don’t wander far from their picnics, leaving the rest of the island empty to enjoy. If you happen to be a part of a tour that briefly stops on Koh Poda, I implore you to make a bit of time after lunch to take a swim and explore a little bit! Of course, the best way to see the island is to do a proper day trip. 
<br><br>
After visiting many other Thai islands and beaches, in both the Andaman and Gulf of Thailand, I stand by Koh Poda as the personal tropical paradise of the south. Even though a day trip sums up to around $20 per person, Koh Poda is a destination worth splurging on. 
<br><br>
Jenelle and I couldn’t stop laughing at how unreal the experience is, truly beyond anything I had imagined.
